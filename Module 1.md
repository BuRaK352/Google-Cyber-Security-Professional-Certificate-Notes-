# Types of Networks

## Local Area Network (LAN)
- Covers a **small area**, such as an office building, school, or home.
- Example: Wi-Fi network at home or in an office.

## Wide Area Network (WAN)
- Covers a **large geographical area**, such as a city, state, or country.
- Example: The Internet can be considered a huge WAN.

# Network Devices
 ### Hub: 
 Broadcasts unfo to every devices on
 ### switch
 makes connections between specisifc devices only sends data where needed
 ### Router 
 connects multiple networkds tgh
 ### modem
 connect a router to the internet

###### ============================================= 
***Firewall is a security device that monitors incoming and outhoing traffic on ur netwrok***
***Servers is provide a service for other devices on the network. whoever connects these servers called "clients" u can check client-server model(get-post)***


### TCP/IP model

- TCP: Transmission Control Protocol, protocol allowing devices to form a connection and stream data.
- IP: Internet Protocol, set of standard for routing and addressing data packets.

1. Network access layer (Ethernet, WLAN): Creating data packets, transferring within network. Includes all hardware.
2. Internet layer (IPv4/6): Where IP addresses are added, connecting between networks.
3. Transport layer (TCP, UDP): Control flow of traffic, error control, permitting connections, etc.
4. Application layer (HTTP, DNS): How the data packets will interact with receiving devices.

### OSI model

1. Physical layer: All the low level hardware.
2. Data link layer: Sending and receiving data packets in-network.
3. Network layer: Transferring packets between networks, handling packet structure.
4. Transport layer: Transferring packets between devices, error handling, speed of transfer.
5. Session layer: Handles all the session-related logic.
6. Presentation layer: Encryption, data confirmation, character encoding.
7. Application layer: Data handled by programs, e.g. a web browser.
